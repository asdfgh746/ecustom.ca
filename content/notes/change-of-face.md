I've changed the typeface used for the main body copy on this site. It was [Freight Text Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro), but I'm now using [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova).

Why the change?

Freight Text wasn't doing it for me anymore. Firstly, it wasn't rendering very nicely for me. Secondly, I wanted to change away from a serif face. We're used to reading sans-serif on the web by now, I don't see a need here for a serif.

Along with changing the typeface, I also decreased the overall type size. It was far too in your face previously. One of the skills of a designer is to know when to apply constraint --- previously I hadn't done so.

The new typeface pairing will be reminiscent of [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com). I mean no disrespect to Dustin, but rather the utmost *respect* as a designer for what he achieved there. I like Proxima Nova as body text, and keeping Freight Sans for the headings looked nicer to me than Proxima Nova did.

I'm hoping the new typeface and type sizing are a bit easier on the eyes for everyone reading here.
