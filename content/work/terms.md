<h1 class="article-title">Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p class="article-intro">These terms and conditions apply to all projects undertaken by Lucas Cherkewski for clients.</p>

Payment of invoices should occur no longer than 30 days after invoices have been issued. Payment using credit card online (processed securely using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ca)) via the invoice page is preferred, though other payment methods can be worked out if necessary.

Extra costs incurred during the project are passed on to the client at direct cost. This includes items such as:

* Usage of third-party services (registering domains or hosting),
* Purchase of third-party products (purchasing a WordPress plugin).

Completion of the project by the agreed-upon date is subject to the client providing to Lucas Cherkewski the required resources for the website at agreed-upon times. This includes resources such as:

* Written content,
* Imagery/photography.

After completion of the project, clients own (where applicable) the resulting deliverable in its entirety. However, clients grant license to Lucas Cherkewski to use their work as examples of his past work.

*These terms and conditions last updated on 2013-07-30.*
