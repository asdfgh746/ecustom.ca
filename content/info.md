I'm lead builder (somewhere between designer and developer) for all my clients. I've been developing rock-solid solutions to design problems for the past few years. If you're interested in working with me, [drop me a line](mailto:lucas@ecustom.ca).

I built this site using some of the web's most awesome technologies. HTML5 and CSS3 (generated by [Compass](http://compass-style.org)) make up the layout and appearance, while [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws) handles the generation. I use the Freight Sans Pro along with Proxima Nova, being served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/), for my typefaces. I host this site on a nice little [Mediatemple](https://www.mediatemple.net) server. The code is all up on [GitHub](https://github.com/lchski/ecustom.ca).
