Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect. We strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that 100% interface.

But are we going about this all wrong?

Notes:

* In the school system, a mark of 'A' means a percentage ranging from 80% to 100%.
* This applies to the design world, too.
* Design doesn't have to be perfect --- a design that looks 80% right still gets the mark of an A.
* NB! This is referring to the implementations of said designs.
* Mockups don't have to be 100% done and final. They can (and should!) change.
