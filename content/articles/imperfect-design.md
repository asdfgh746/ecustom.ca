Notes:

* In the school system, a mark of 'A' means a percentage ranging from 80% to 100%.
* This applies to the design world, too.
* Design doesn't have to be perfect --- a design that looks 80% right still gets the mark of an A.
* NB! This is referring to the implementations of said designs.
* Mockups don't have to be 100% done and final. They can (and should!) change.
