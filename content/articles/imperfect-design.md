Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect. We strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that perfect interface.

But are we going about this all wrong?

*I think we are.*

## School marks

To help illustrate my point, I'd like to bring the discussion to school marks, specifically marks in highschool.

Marks in highschool are a funny thing. All through our education up to that point, we're taught that a mark of A (or the coveted A+) is the ultimate standard to achieve. By logic, then, we should see it as 100%, because we can't go any higher.

However, what we see in highschool is actually quite different.

When we arrive at highschool, with our eyes on the look out for bullies in the washrooms, what we hear from our teachers is that an A mark is actually part of a *range of percentages*. (It's at this point my mind was blown when I first received percentage marks.)

So if our "ultimate standard" is no longer represented by a mark of 100%, but rather a mark from 80% to 100%, we realize that that standard is actually easier to achieve.

## The standard shifts

Highschool marks teach us that an A isn't necessarily 100%. An A (what we think to be the ultimate achievement), can be represented by range of marks.

This is a really good thing.

Let's look at design through this lens. How can our designs benefit from us using a range of "marks" to judge our work, instead of just 100%?

## Design isn't perfect



Notes:

* In the school system, a mark of 'A' means a percentage ranging from 80% to 100%.
* This applies to the design world, too.
* Design doesn't have to be perfect --- a design that looks 80% right still gets the mark of an A.
* NB! This is referring to the implementations of said designs.
* Mockups don't have to be 100% done and final. They can (and should!) change.
