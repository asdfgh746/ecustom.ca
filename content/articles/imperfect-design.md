summary: We think designs have to be 100% perfect to meet our high standards. But is that really the case?

<p class="article-intro">
	Too often in design, we get caught up with the idea that a design has to be (or even can be) perfect.
</p>

With this mindset, we strive, we push ourselves to create the best possible interface for our users. We work hard to achieve that perfect interface.

But are we going about this all wrong?

*I think we are.*

## School marks

To help illustrate my point, I'd like to bring the discussion to school marks, specifically marks in highschool.

Marks in highschool are a funny thing. All through our education up to that point, we're taught that a mark of A (or the coveted A+) is the ultimate standard to achieve. By logic, then, we should see it as 100%, because we can't go any higher.

However, what we see in highschool is actually quite different.

When we arrive at highschool, with our eyes on the look out for bullies in the washrooms, what we hear from our teachers is that an A mark is actually part of a *range of percentages*. (It's at this point my mind was blown when I first received percentage marks.)

So if our "ultimate standard" is no longer represented by a mark of 100%, but rather a mark from 80% to 100%, we realize that that standard is actually easier to achieve.

## The standard shifts

Highschool marks teach us that an A isn't necessarily 100%. An A (what we think to be the ultimate achievement), can be represented by range of marks.

This is a really good thing.

Let's look at design through this lens. How can our designs benefit from us using a range of "marks" to judge our work, instead of just 100%?

## Design isn't perfect

What can we take away from highschool marks? Design doesn't have to be perfect. The high standard that we want to achieve is possible without toiling forever to create that mythical 100% design.

A design that looks 80% right still gets an A mark.

This can benefit us greatly:

- We stop spending too much time designing things;
- Our newfound time can be used talking with customers to find out what they think;
- This feedback can be used to improve the design the way customer's want it to be improved.

Suddenly taking that extra time we'd have spent delaying our product's launch because we wanted the design to be perfect seems much better spent.

**Design isn't perfect. Don't try to make it be. You can still get an A without getting 100%.**
