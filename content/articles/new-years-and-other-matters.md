Articles about New Year&rsquo;s resolutions are a dime a dozen this time of year. Generally speaking, I find the notion of New Year&rsquo;s resolutions to be contrived&mdash;why are we choosing *this specific day* to choose how we&rsquo;d like to change ourselves within merely the confines of the coming year? There&rsquo;s little appreciable gain to doing it this time of year, and yet society, as it so often does, moves as one to do so.

Even so, the occasion of everyone else rushing to journal their resolutions for the coming year has given me cause to write up this little piece. It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote here, and as always I won&rsquo;t promise that that will change any time soon. I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time writing for myself lately, and the result of that is less writing which makes it to the eyes of the public.

While you won&rsquo;t find any New Year&rsquo;s resolutions in this piece, I will point you in the direction of an essay I&rsquo;m publishing alongside this article. *[A Hard Floor](http://ecustom.ca/articles/a-hard-floor/)* takes a look at how to avoid the issue of complacency&mdash;a matter I consider very important, especially this time of year when we consider ourselves to be in a place wherein we are capable of changing ourselves. (As if that&rsquo;s not possible any other time of year.)

If it could be said that I&rsquo;m making any New Year&rsquo;s resolution, it&rsquo;s that I wish to avoid complacency, as detailed in said piece. By bringing in a change of scenery and new surroundings when appropriate, I hope to avoid the inevitable stasis that complacency brings to all parts of life. I predict that I&rsquo;ll be changing things up quite a lot in my life throughout the coming year, just as I&rsquo;ve done this past one.

For those of you who have resolved to communicate better in the New Year, I&rsquo;d love to get in touch&mdash;and stay that way! For communication in 140 characters or less (a limit which is both freeing and yet idea-crushing), you can [find me on twitter](https://twitter.com/lchski), where I tweet far too many times a day. For online communication of a longer form, [emailing me](mailto:lucas@ecustom.ca) will always work. (Though, be warned that with email it may take some time before I have the energy to give you an appropriately considered response.)

As much as I love online communication, I&rsquo;m starting to see through its conveniences for its drawbacks. As such, I&rsquo;m interested in starting up conversations via pen and paper&mdash;using letters, the old fashioned way. I&rsquo;ve realized that this method has benefits which we overlooked when making the jump to digital methods, and I&rsquo;d love to get in to regular correspondence with you. If that&rsquo;s something that appeals to you, all it takes is reaching out to me via either [a tweet](https://twitter.com/lchski) or [an email](mailto:lucas@ecustom.ca) so that we can exchange addresses and get underway.

As much as I despise the contrived change that people impose upon themselves this time of year, I recognize that it&rsquo;s still a time of fun and happiness for all. I&rsquo;m certainly feeling that way, and I hope you are, too. It&rsquo;s a wonderful time to be alive.

I&rsquo;ll close this little update with a quote from one of my favourite journalists. Let this be one of your references in this New Year of change:

&ldquo;Seek the truth, keep people honest, explore the world, and laugh at the absurdity of it all.&rdquo; &mdash; Walter Cronkite
