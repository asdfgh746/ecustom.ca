Don't list features for your fancy new web product.

People don't care that much about the fact that your service integrates with Dropbox, and Evernote, and Box, and iCloud, and your refrigerator.

People do care about what your service will do for them. They don't care about how it will do it.

This extends to working with clients, too. Don't sell your client on the fact that you'll create a "WordPress site" for them. Usually, they won't know about the technology, and they won't care.

They do care about the fact that the website you provide them will do the job they need.

Teach people what it is that your service can do for them. Not how it will do it.
