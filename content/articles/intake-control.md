In light of recent events, all I want to say is this: we control what news we take in about the news.

We can either seek out the bad things, those which weigh heavily on us, or we can seek out the good things, those little joys which remind us that there’s more to life than just tragedy.

We can’t stop things outside of our control. We *can* affect what we see and hear about.
