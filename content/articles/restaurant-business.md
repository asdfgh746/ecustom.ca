The restaurant industry is an excellent industry from which to draw inspiration. They've got proven models that they've developed over countless years perfecting their craft.

There's an interesting trend in restaurants. As they progress along the "reputation scale," they start offering less and less customizations.

Your average chain fast food place will probably let you customize your meal to the nth degree. But once you get to more impressive restaurants, where the culinary staff are renowned for their skill and talent (one might even say they've developed ...), the options for customization are far less.

This is because of the talent of those culinary staff.
