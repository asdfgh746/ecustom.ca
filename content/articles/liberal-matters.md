The public writing published by myself of late has seen a drop in both quantity and quality. Much of this drop may be attributed to a certain laziness of the mind which I have allowed myself to lapse into. Such a laziness derives itself from my activities&mdash;with a focus on practical subjects, there has been little to inspire and engage the mind.

A focus on practical subjects, useful though they may be, is ultimately a weakness in one's ability to think independently. Practical subjects encourage a "group think" mentality, wherein all those engaging in such subjects draw similar (or, worse, the same) conclusions about an issue. The prevalence of this "group think" mentality puts at risk the ability of the entire human race to advance. Without the independent thought offered by subjects of a less practical nature, we lose our ability to debate and draw differing conclusions over the same issue. Such an ability is essential if we are to continue to find ways to advance as a collective of individuals&mdash;as opposed to a collective of identicals.

To address the over-prevalence of practical thinking which faces our collective, I am engaging in a return to subjects of a less practical nature&mdash;subjects in the oft-ridiculed "liberal arts." Such a return has numerous implications:

1. A focus on literature of liberal natures.
2. A routine of writing&mdash;both observations and conclusions.
3. A pursuit of intelligent discourse&mdash;conversation and debate to engage and inspire.
